South African police service has a problem keeping track of dockets. The current system is paper based and often dockets go missing or get lost. Paper based dockets may also get damaged, making it difficult to see the docket details.  My solution is to make this an electronic based system. The e-docket system will allow officers to create dockets, update dockets and in some cases delete dockets. This will also be more secure than the old docket system, when a e-docket is deleted the system will state who deleted it. This eliminates corruption. The e-docket system will state who created the docket, the complainant, the nature of the crime reported, witness details and suspect details. Evidence will be given a unique id number and stored in the system. Only an officer who created the docket may edit it unless changed by an administrator. An officer may update a docket when there is progress made. This will all be stored on a database to make it easier to look up cases. This will allow a faster more fluent process when creating a docket. An administrator will have access to all the information but will not he able to edit it. The administrator will only be allowed to change the officer assigned to a case and view all dockets on the system. The data analyst will be able to view the total number of cases and officers in the current station.
